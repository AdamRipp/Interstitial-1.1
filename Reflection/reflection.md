# Introduction

Coming into Hist3812 I was unsure what to expect. When I was told that the class would be exploring history through different mediums than most classes I was slightly concerned. I have never been overly keen to use technology despite the fact that I knew it could be a great tool to use. So far in this course I have learned how to use a few different applications such as Github, Obsidian, Mural, and Twine. I am not compleatly comfortable with all the applications we have used so far however I am learning.

Module 1 in this course was storytelling and during this module I have learned how storytelling can be integral to learning history. On of the first things I learned was that history and learning history should be fun. In the world of acedemics histroy has become boring. People studying ancient civilizations or great battles have dulled down these extremely interesting things into acedemic articles full of facts but deviod of any excitment. The problem of history becoming too serious is outlined by T. Mills Kelly a history proffesor who realized his class was disengaged in his historical methods class. Mills Kelly realized that by teaching his class a more fun approach to history they would become more engaged and in turn would get more out of the class and better understand the lessons Mills Kelly was trying to get across. Mills Kelly got his students to create and then spread a historical lie about the last American pirate. The response to the historical lie in acedemia was incredable as many acedemics in the feild of history were amazed with how much effort a student put into a history project, that was until they discovered that the project was one big fabrication. Mills Kelly's methods showed me that having more fun while studying history can make me a better historian.

Another thing I learned in this module was about narrative structures. Narrative structures are integral to how we percive a narrative or event and narrative structures are created to tell a story in a certian way. Narrative structures can be linear, an example of this would be many museum exhibits. Many exhibits in museums have a clear start and end point with only one path to take between these points. A linear narritive stucture is good for telling one specific narrative as people will absorb the information given to them in the order it was intended, the problem with this is that there is always multiple ways to look at history or a historical event meaning that presenting history linearly will limit what a person can learn.
